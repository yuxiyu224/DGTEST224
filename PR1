## Summary
This PR implements the initial version of the GitHub synchronization module for Deepguide.  
It enables importing GitHub Issues and Pull Requests as structured data sources for AI-driven documentation generation.

## Implementation Details
- Added a new module `github_sync.py` that handles authentication, data fetching, and indexing.
- Integrated GitHub REST API endpoints:
  - `/issues`
  - `/pulls`
- Introduced data normalization logic to map GitHub fields (e.g., `title`, `body`, `labels`, `state`) into Deepguideâ€™s internal schema.
- Updated documentation generator to utilize synced PR/Issue data.

## Testing
- Connected to test repo `yuxiyu224/DGTEST224`
- Synced Issues and PRs successfully.
- Verified that Deepguide auto-generates draft documentation from these data sources.

## Expected Outcome
Once merged, Deepguide will:
1. Continuously sync GitHub data sources.
2. Automatically create or update documentation pages reflecting the latest development context.

**Next Steps**
- Add webhook-based auto-refresh.
- Support GitLab integration.
